        <h3>Revo</h3>
        <p>
            The process of returning items purchased online wastes $84 billion worldwide every year, and it is predicted that this will only continue to rise. Returned items are becoming an increasingly significant problem in warehouses as 30% of pro- ducts ordered online are returned and 40% of those are being destroyed at the warehouse. Additionally, the returns process contributes 146,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually. Despite the fact that most departments and processes in warehouses have been improved, there is still no solution for the return process.
        </p>
        <p>
            The revoProcess is changing the way companies tackle current issues in the returns system. revo is a returns service that reduces the return workload in warehouses. The service is built on the idea of sending returned items directly from customer to customer.
