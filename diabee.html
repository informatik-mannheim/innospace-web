        <h3>Diabee</h3>
        <p>
            Diabees mission is to enable needs-based disease management strategies for people with diabetes (pwd) while optimizing healthcare professional's (hcps) time utilization and reducing healthcare expenditure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Diabetes is a global phenomenon that currently affects more than 425 million people around the world. Living with diabetes can result in huge psychological pressure as the condition requires constant attention. Indeed, neglecting diabetes care over time can lead to severe complications or even death. Each PwD has individual needs and circumstances. Most healthcare systems, however, currently do not cater to these diverse settings. Generally, treatment approaches are standardized and care is rarely personalized. This state of affairs emphasizes that there is a clear need for new disruptive innovations in the field of diabetes management. Patients and HCPs alike are constantly challenged when managing chronic diseases. Successfully treating a condition like diabetes demands (1) close collaboration between diverse stakeholders, (2) life-long learning trajectories, and (3) constant data collection and monitoring. Ideally, this is achieved without unnecessarily burdening the people involved
