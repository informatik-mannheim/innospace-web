      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <h3>What drives us?</h3>
        <p>At inno.space, we work with partners from large corporate organisations and small    and medium enterprises to develop projects that address real-world challenges. 
            We support various educational concepts that foster complex problem-solving, innovation and entrepreneurship. Our goal is to unleash the creative potential of our students and educate them to become creative future-makers as well as leaders in entrepreneurial settings or in start-ups and to be well prepared for the responsibilities and challenges in their professional life which we cannot foresee today.<br/><br/>
            Together, we build the future!

        <h3>What do we do?</h3>
        <p>Our educational programs focus on passion-based learning & learning by doing. They offer the possibility to work in international and interdisciplinary teams, mixing engineering, design, business, computer science and more. Students from HS Mannheim from all faculties work on innovation challenges proposed by national and international business partners. Students undergo an intensive and iterative process to create and develop new product or service ideas, materialized into proof of concept prototypes. Projects come from large and small companies, and from a variety of industries including consumer electronics, automotive, telecommunications, healthcare, aeronautics, software, household products, transportation, and government. For the companies this is a low risk opportunity to get introduced to the innovation approach in the business context of their own company, to identify new business opportunities and to get introduced to a systematic way to bring Innovation into their company. The methodology we apply in our programs is, in general, strongly inspired by the Stanford Design Innovation Process.

            <p>With the increasing technical possibilities and the growing competition of globally operating companies, the importance of innovation also grows in order to stay in the game. Design Thinking is a promising approach to be in the front line of innovation. This method can be applied to design products, services and processes. It t is based on collaborative creativity in multidisciplinary teams and has its core in the user and continuous iteration. This means that process is driven by the people, real humans with pains and needs. Teams go through several stages of the process: user and market reasearch, ideation, prototyping and testing and have the freedom to adapt these phases to better suit their challenge. By building and learning from people's needs as well as testing with real users, the concepts represent a holistic integration of the three main pillars for sustainable innovation, desirability, viability and feasability.</p>
