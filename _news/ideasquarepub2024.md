*“Making Skills: How Courses on Digital Fabrication Enhance 21st-Century Skills” – Published in CERN IdeaSquare Journal*

We are delighted to announce that our paper “Making Skills: How Courses on Digital Fabrication Enhance 21st-Century Skills” has been accepted and published in the CERN IdeaSquare Journal of Experimental Innovation (CIJ), Volume 8, Number 2 (2024).


In this work, we examine a series of digital fabrication micro-courses offered at our Design Factory, and evaluate how these courses contribute not only to practical making and prototyping capabilities, but also to wider 21st-century skills such as self-efficacy, self-initiative, and learning competence.


Our evaluation shows that the course design decisions positively impact students’ growth in these skills, and we believe our findings can serve as inspiration for other universities, makerspaces, or educational institutions aiming to embed hands-on fabrication-based learning into their curricula.


We are proud to have this research featured in a respected venue like CERN’s IdeaSquare Journal. A big thank you to all team members and contributors for their efforts, and to the journal editors for enabling us to share our work with the wider experimental innovation community.
