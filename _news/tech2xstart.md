*From 21–23 July 2025, the IEEE German Education Conference (GECon 2025) took place in Hamburg under the theme Networking Education in Germany.*

We are pleased to inform you that the TECH2X project has officially begun. This European project brings together a diverse consortium of partners, including:

* Esade Business School
* Alma Mater Studiorum – Università di Bologna (UNIBO)
* inno.space – Design Factory Mannheim at Hochschule Mannheim
* METU Design Factory at Middle East Technical University (METU)
* CERN IdeaSquare – the innovation space at CERN
* Almacube – an experienced innovation hub-incubator-accelerator

The primary objective of TECH2X is to boost the innovation and entrepreneurial capacity of the consortium’s higher education institutions (HEIs) to foster deep-tech talent and support the transition towards the fourth-generation university model. This will be achieved through practice-based collaborations and enhanced networking within, between, and beyond our institutions, focusing on the areas of climate and mobility.

Key activities of the project include:

* Designing and delivering comprehensive education and training programs on tech-driven innovation for sustainable futures.
* Developing structures and conditions to facilitate innovation and entrepreneurship capacities.
* Establishing and enhancing mechanisms within HEIs for individuals to create or develop their businesses/start-ups.
* Expanding and enriching networks and ecosystem connections.
* Disseminating successes and scaling initiatives within our HEIs and wider partner networks.

The project is set to run from April 2025 to April 2027. For more information, please visit the official [project website](https://www.tech2x.eu).
We look forward to the collaborative efforts and outcomes that will emerge from this exciting initiative.
