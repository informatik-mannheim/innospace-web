### **C.A.R.L** 

C.A.R.L is a machine that can recycle old clothes into whichever new items a person desires. This allows users to participate in a more sustainable clothing consumption experience with amenities, interactive features, and other educational tools. C.A.R.L focuses on reharvesting all the materials in the old garments rather than trying to restore the original garment. It promotes a circular economy by localizing recycling and production, also canceling the need for a transport chain of imports and exports.
