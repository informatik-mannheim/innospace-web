This is the text for a news article! It has been taken directly from markdown, which I assume means that markdown syntax can be used.
As far as I can understand, videos can also be included with html tags, or links added in classic markdown fashion.

Of course I would assume that news posts are normally a bit longer, and maybe we want to include a functionality to link to external sources (e.g. LinkedIn),
but all in all this is a pretty ok template :)

### I think headings are possible in markdown as well

Oh wow! This is pretty cool actually
