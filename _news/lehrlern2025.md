On 9 October 2025, the Lehr-Lernkonferenz 2025 ([conference homepage](https://www.lehrlernkonferenz-2025.de/)) brought together educators and researchers under the theme “Together but not in the same place – Collaborative Learning in Hybrid Teaching-Learning Settings”. We were pleased to participate with an interactive exhibition presenting the results of our SHELLS funding project:


Since 2014, inno.space at THM has been offering international and interdisciplinary Challenge-Based Courses (5, 10, and 20 ECTS) for students. Hybrid teamwork is a central element in all these courses. Students collaborate in (inter-)national and interdisciplinary teams across multiple locations, tackling challenges from research, civil society, or industry.


We have systematized our experiences into a methods toolkit, which combines participation modalities (on-site, remote, remote as a group) with different learning activities (theory, coaching, team work, etc.). This collection of best practices supports the successful design of teaching across multiple locations.


At our interactive exhibition, we showcased the technical and methodological possibilities of these toolkit modules, allowing visitors to experience how hybrid, collaborative teaching and learning can be effectively implemented.


Our participation highlighted the practical insights and solutions developed through SHELLS, demonstrating how hybrid team-based courses can foster student learning and collaboration in international, interdisciplinary settings.
