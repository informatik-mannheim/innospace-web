# News posts are summarized into pages, each page contains three articles
# This structure was implemented to fit with the pagination from testimonials, 
# because each dot in the pagination represents one page, and each page contains three news articles

# GUIDE FOR ADDING NEW NEWS ARTICLES:
# (it's a bit more complicated, I'm sorry)
# For a news article to show up on the first page, it needs to be at the top of this yml file
# It's possible for a page to contain only one article, however, ideally you would configure so that the last page, not the first, is incomplete
# So: Add the newest article at the top in the same structure, then move other articles to fit desired page structure
