MINT is a system thatâ€™s utilizes an AI avatar to engage in therapeutic conversations with patients, while cameras, sensors, and microphones gather essential information. While it cannot diagnose mental health conditions, it can provide a mental health evaluation, prioritize appointments for high-risk cases, and develop a treatment plan in collaboration with the therapist and patient.
