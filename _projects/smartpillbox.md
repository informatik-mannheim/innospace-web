### **Smart Pillbox** 

Senior citizens and their relatives often face the challenge of ensuring that medication is taken regularly and correctly. Forgetting doses or not knowing whether they have been taken can have serious consequences.

The Smart Pill Box is an intelligent system that automatically dispenses medication at the right time. It uses visual and acoustic signals to remind patients to take their medication, checks whether medication has been taken and sends notifications to relatives if medication has not been taken. This box has space for a week's supply of medication and was specially developed for senior citizens to enable them to live safely and independently. The Smart Pill Box combines technology and care in a compact design that brings safety and convenience to everyday life.
Safety, comfort and innovation - in one box! Celebrate this ground-breaking solution with us.
