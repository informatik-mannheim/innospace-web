### **Glassified** 

This project aimed to develop a sustainable alternative to plastic everyday objects by replacing
them with glass. Several prototypes were considered. The glass ID card emerged as the primary
solution, offering durability, security, and personalized customization options. Challenges were
faced during the prototyping phase, particularly with the handling of the sponsor's unique glass
material. However, through collaboration, problem-solving and design thinking, these challenges
were overcome. The glass ID card proved to be a sustainable alternative to plastic, reducing
environmental impact and incorporating advanced security features. This project demonstrates
the potential of glass as an eco-friendly option for everyday items, contributing to the reduction of
plastic waste and promoting sustainable practices while also highlighting the advantages and
disadvantages of recycling. Further development is required to optimize glass-based solutions for
mass production and widespread adoption.
