### **HITA Community Forum** 

The management, maintenance and sustainable operation of hospital beds insmall and medium-sized hospitals in rural areas of Ghana pose numerouschallenges. To address the issues, HITA e.V. supports the development ofhealthcare systems in Africa, particularly in Ghana. Their focus is on utilizingmodern information and communication technologies to improve and promotethe training of non-physician personnel.Within the iPDP project, the challenge of “How can the administration,maintenance and sustainable operation of hospital beds in the smallest, smalland medium-sized hospitals in rural areas of Ghana be improved, supported andensured through an administration tool/interactive system?” was addressed.The developed solution consists of a forum and a knowledge base that provideproven solutions. The interactive system facilitates the exchange of knowledgeand experiences among healthcare personnel in rural areas of Ghana. Throughdiscussions and the sharing of best practices, problems are identified, andinnovative solutions are developed. Simultaneously, an extensive knowledge baseis being built, containing information and proven procedures for effective hospitalbed management.The solution aims to facilitate access to relevant information, enhance efficiencyand ensure the sustainable operation of hospital beds in rural areas of Ghana. Bysupporting non-physician personnel and promoting knowledge transfer, the goalis to improve healthcare delivery in Ghana.
