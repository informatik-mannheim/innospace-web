### **Cleveron Kiosk** 

Cleveron is an Estonian company focused on the development of robotic-based parcel terminals. Its new product, the self-service kiosk Cleveron 102, enables retailers to sell goods without needing a customer associate to be present.

Upon the release of their newest self-service kiosk, they challenged our students to identify innovative and yet unexplored areas for its use. After many interviews, the team identified a major challenge in the travel domain, namely frustrating queues and waiting times, that can be addressed with the kiosk.

The Cleveron Kiosk concept enables users at airports and other major travel hubs to rent a car or pick up keys for accommodation via the kiosk, thus significantly relieving the stress for users, both those on vacation and business trips. The opportunity to complete three tasks - car rental, accommodation arrangement and buying additional amenities (snacks, drinks, chargers) - makes the kiosk a welcoming sight at each airport.
