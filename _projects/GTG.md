### **ReCreate** 

ReCreate is a system consisting of three core parts: ReNate, SeDrone and VeDA â€“ together they probe and analyze deserted land and develop a renaturation strategy that is suited best for that specific area. While it is a partly autonomous system, there are many humans involved in the planning and creation of new ecosystems.
