### **SafeSpaceMonitor** 

The journey of the SafeSpace-Monitor team within the Prototype It Yourself course was marked by an exploration of unique ideas rather than a predefined challenge.

In addressing the practical scenario where individuals often rely on multiple devices to monitor values such as CO, CO2, humidity, or temperature, SafeSpace-Monitor aimed to simplify this process. Their focus was on identifying effective visual and auditory signals to convey essential information.

The outcome is the SafeSpace-Monitor All-in-one Detectorâ€”a portable solution that transcends traditional monitoring methods. The device, conceptualized within the Prototype It Yourself course, features a built-in display offering real-time readings of CO, CO2, humidity, and temperature, powered by an internal source. In situations of potential hazard, the detector emits customized auditory signals and illuminates in different colors, adapting to various danger scenarios.

The SafeSpace-Monitor team's dedication to enhancing safety, whether at home or on the go, invites observers to acknowledge their exploration of innovative possibilities.
