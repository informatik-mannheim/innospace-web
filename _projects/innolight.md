### **inno.light** 

Our project aims to design and develop a hyperspectral imaging scanner mounted on vertically movable wall rails. 
The system seeks to identify areas where sunscreen may have been applied sparingly or missed entirely. 
By utilizing advanced hyperspectral imaging technology, the scanner captures detailed spectral information to map out vulnerable skin regions. 
The results are displayed on an additional screen enabling users to have a near-instant feedback on their sun protection. This approach enhances precise and effective application of sunscreen 
to significantly minimize the risk of skin damage from sunlight. It is poised to revolutionize personal health and serve as a preventive measure against skin cancer.
