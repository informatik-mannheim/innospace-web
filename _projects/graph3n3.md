### **graph3n3** 


The aim of the project was to find use cases for GMODs, a reflective display using graphene, 
that would provide a good market entry point for Megamorph.  This is important because the price of graphene is currently high and can deter customers. 
That is why yacht screens were identified as an excellent use case for graphene, because price is less of an issue in the yacht market and yacht screens 
make perfect use of graphene's reflective properties as well as its strength and durability. There are also several different possibilities to expand the 
idea that could be used moving forward.
