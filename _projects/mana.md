### **MANA** 

Our Sponsor “HITA e.V.” is a NGO supporting health systems in rural areas of Africa. With afocus on Ghana, HITA e.V. uses modern information and communication technologies tosustainably support and improve the training of non-medical personnel. Within theirproject “ 1Bed4All' HITA is pursuing the goal of combating the "no-bed syndrome" in Ghana.Though besides the actual delivery of hospital beds from Germany to Ghana, a sustainableenabling and empowerment concept for the staff has also to be developed andimplemented to ensure the proper use of the beds in the long term. With the Question
"How can an administration tool / interactive system improve, support and ensure themanagement, maintenance and sustainable operation of hospital beds in micro, small andmedium hospitals in rural Ghana?"
provided by HITA started our Design Thinking journey through the whole semester.By using several methods of design thinking and driven by desire to help people in Ghanaas well as support HITA in achieving their goals, we developed the MANA solution system.The MANA solution system consists of various components, which provide low-techsolutions combined with temporary internet access to support bed usage andmaintenance. As a result MANA improves transparency, efficiency, maintenance processes,communication and overall patient care in hospitals with limited connectivity.
