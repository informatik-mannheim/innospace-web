### **Sunny** 

UV radiation is omnipresent and can quickly become a danger if sun protection is not renewed in good time. When hiking, at the beach or working outdoors, it is difficult to keep track of UV exposure and the effectiveness of sun cream.

Sunny is a small, portable device that measures the UV index in real time and shows it on an easy-to-read display. After entering the sun protection factor, Sunny calculates how long the sun protection will last with the current UV exposure and reminds you to apply sun cream in good time. Sunny is the perfect companion for hikers, swimmers and anyone who enjoys spending time outdoors. It makes sun protection easier, more reliable and smarter.
Enjoy the sun - protected and carefree! Celebrate this smart innovation with us.
