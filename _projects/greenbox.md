### **Greenbox** 

This team also tackled the challenge: "How can we use smart objects to help people know about climate change and act accordingly?"

To find out what their fellow human beings need, or what you are still missing for a more environmentally conscious life, they conducted interviews. They got some input, but ultimately they had to choose one. The Greenbox was their winner. With it, they are reaching some people. Most of them have a car and - to be honest - use it way too much.

The Greenbox helps the user to actively rethink his usage behavior regarding his car. Our key box gives incentives to cover shorter distances by other means of transport, such as cycling or walking. Colored LEDs give the user feedback on his driving behavior.
