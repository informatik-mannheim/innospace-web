### **Team tartutata** 

Our sponsor was Contagt, a young and innovative software development company based
in Mannheim. They want to do for indoor guidance what google did for outdoor guidance:
Build a simple navigation system to find your way to the room.
The challenge Contagt gave us was to tinker with an extension/ a module to the already
existing system that would help in an emergency inside a building.

To solve this challenge, we came up with three prototypes:
1. An emergency module for building visitors
2. An emergency helper module for first responders
3. A pocket beacon for visitors who canâ€™t use the Contagt app

The first prototype is used to guide a person out of the building as quickly as possible, to
find nearby emergency kits, fire extinguishers and AEDs and to further assist the person by
providing direct access to emergency personnel, as well as a sheet for giving first-aid.
The second prototype is the counterpart to the emergency module. With the emergency
helper module, first responders are able to locate people inside the building, are able to
get a quick overview of the possible health status and answer video call requests inside
the building.
The last prototype is a physical device, given to the visitor at the entrance of the building.
It is also used to guide a person out of the building.
