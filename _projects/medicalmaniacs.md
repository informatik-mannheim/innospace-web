### **Medical Maniacs** 

Combining the pandemic situation with a high-tech solution from ECsens raises the question: “How might we implement pathways for a new approach on LiquidBiopsy Testing?” and as a consequence: “How might we integrate the device from ECsense into digital healthcare data 
structure”?

ECsens already developed a solution.

The huge benefit of the ECSense sensor is the ease of use combined with high accuracy and reliability. PCR-Tests might be very accurate as well but as many critics mentioned during the pandemic it was never designed to be a mass screening diagnostics tool. The test is very susceptible to contamination because of its many steps and handling procedures. The ECsense procedure in comparison is very similar to the covid quick tests every supermarket sells, therefore, minimal training and sample handling are needed which leads to higher testing capabilities with a lower risk of contaminations and as a result even higher reliability than PCR-Tests.
The solution consists of one hand of a box, about the size of a coffee machine. This box can be used anywhere. You could for example place them in ambulances, hospitals, or other places of medical care. There could even be a rental service for conferences and other large gatherings of people. In this case, the tests are performed by trained personnel to make the precision and reliability of the ECsens device reach its full potential. The second part of the solution is a framework, where the data is processed by an algorithm too, but not directly sent back to the patient to have a medical professional make the final judgment on the result. This way, the system provides official test results for every possible need.
