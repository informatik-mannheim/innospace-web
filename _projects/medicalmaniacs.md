### **Medical Maniacs** 

Combining the Pandemic situation with a high-tec solution from ECsens raises the question: “ How might we implement pathways for a new approach on LiquidBiopsy Testing?" and as a consequence: " How might we integrate the device from ECSense into digital healthcare datastructure"?

ECsens allready develloped a solution fpor

The huge benefit of the ECSense Sensor is the ease of use combined witht hehigh accuracy and reliability.
PCR-Test might be very accurate as well but as many Critics mentoned during the Pandemic it was never designed to be a mass screening diagnostics tool. 
The test is very susceptible to contamination because of its many steps 
and handling procedures.
The ECSense procedure in comparison is very Similar to the covid quick tests every
Supermarket sells therefore minimal training and sample handling is needed which leads to
higher testing capabilities with a lower risk of contaminations and as a result to an even higher
reliability as PCR-Tests.

The solution consists on one hand of a box, about the
size of a Coffee Machine. This box can be used basically anywhere. You could
for example place them in ambulances, hospitals or other places of
medical care. There could even be a rental service for conferences and
other large gatherings of people. In this case
the tests are performed by trained personnel to make the precision and
reliability of the ECSens device reach its full potential. The second part of the Solution is a framework, where the data is
processed by an algorithm too, but not directly sent back to the patient to
have a Medical Professional make the final judgment on the result. This
way, the system provides official test results for every possible need.
