### **Tartu Citizen Participation**

Smart City Tartu challenged our students to understand why young people in the highly popular student city aren't particularly involved in city life and why they don't perceive it beneficial to become registered Tartu citizens.

In what proved to be a complex and multifaceted journey, the team used a survey which gathered 450 responses to uncover the needs of Tartu's young people and address them with an app allowing direct citizen participation with a gamification aspect. With features such as a voting section, giving the city the opportunity to elicit direct feedback from its citizens, a feedback section where citizens can suggest improvements and report problems and the benefits section where people can take advantage of free services thanks to their active partaking in city life.
