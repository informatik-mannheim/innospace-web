### **Cirrus** 

Health and well-being are gaining an increasing amount of attention as bodies and minds are being shaped, improved and strengthened in everyoneâ€™s home environment. People try to live more consciously, aiming to reduce stress from private and professional lives. More than just a place for physical cleaning, the bathroom is becoming a space for physical and mental self-care. 

Cirrus is a lightweight, portable steamer for home, vacation or even business trip use, making self-care routines easier wherever you are. The original usage focus is facial skincare, however for any other uses such as skin preparation for shaving or muscle relaxation (and so many more) the product is just as useful. Cold steam has been especially favored for hot summers and for vitalizing and refreshing the skin. Cirrus has the potential to positively impact the users wellbeing greatly through its portable and intuitive design. It also offers a great potential for future growth, adjustments and additions to the steamer itself, such as essential oil collaborations, function improvements and setup alternatives.
