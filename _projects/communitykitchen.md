### Community Kitchen

Studies show that life expectancy of people with lower income in Germany is below average. One of several reasons for this are unhealthy eating habits and overweight. This is not only a question of income. Therefore the City of Mannheim challenged our team with the question: How might we support the eating habits of lower-income citizens towards a healthier and more sustainable food consumption in order to increase their health and wellbeing as well as to decrease the CO2 footprint of the overall food consumption?

The team spent a lot of time putting themselves in the shoes of the target groups, and in the end, they focused on the aspect of a community. The idea of a shared kitchen aims to give people who are interested in cooking the opportunity to introduce people to healthy food and the enjoyment of preparing it.
