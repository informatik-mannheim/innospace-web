### **A.C.C.O.S** 

Unavoidable CO2 emissions of the cement industry are a pressing issue contributing to climate change. Our project tackles this by offering a leasing service for a modular microalgae CO2 capturing system called A.C.C.O.S (algae based carbon capturing facility on site). These systems efficiently capture CO2 emissions, mitigating environmental impact. Additionally, the resulting biomass is utilized for various products, promoting a circular economy and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Our aim is to combat climate change by providing an innovative solution that addresses both CO2 emissions and resource utilization.
