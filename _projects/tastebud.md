### **TasteBud** 

The Coffee Store posed the challenge “How might we enable end customers to configure their individual flavour profile as a key feature of an online coffee shop?”.
Through many interviews and iterations the team discovered that the actual problem is that people do not have enough vocabulary concerning flavour (and that is not even limited to coffee). Their main goal became educating the consumer and expanding their flavour horizons.

That is how TasteBud was born, an innovative tool assisting the user in broadening their knowledge base of flavours, while simultaneously building their taste profile. Through playful, gamified interaction and social components, the user is guided towards identifying the most fitting flavours. The user can taste a variety of recommended foods randing from chocolate and vanilla to exotic foods and spices such as szechuan pepper, share their taste impression, gather experience points and leave rating and social comments. The resulting taste profile can then be imported into online stores, such as that of the challenge-giver The Coffee Store, and used to recommend different taste-related products such as coffee, wine, cheese, etc.
