### **InCosy** 

InCosy is an innovative system designed to address the challenges faced by caregivers. It streamlines the process of collecting caregiver concerns during shift handovers and offers practical solutions through curated product recommendations. 
When a caregiver chooses a suggested solution, it seamlessly forwards the selection to the home lead who can then acquire the product and introduce it through a guided team briefing.
 Furthermore, to continuously enhance the system, caregivers are regularly invited to provide feedback, ensuring ongoing improvements and refinements to the suggestion system.
