### **Mycosonic** 

The trajectory of MycoSonic's foray into the Prototype It Yourself course echoes a similar sentiment, characterized by an exploration of uncharted ideas rather than a rigidly defined challenge.

In their pursuit, MycoSonic sought to redefine the landscape of musical expression by collaborating with nature. Unlike a predetermined challenge, their focus was on the development of instruments and teaching methods inspired by the natural world. The goal? To provide musicians with novel avenues for creative exploration, much like the team's persona, Konrad.

The culmination of this exploration is the MycoSonic MKI, a compact device that transcends traditional musical instruments. Unlike the conventional, it empowers users to measure the bioelectricity of fungi and plants, converting it into customizable tones. The emphasis lies not on a predefined challenge but on the innovation itself â€“ a testament to MycoSonic's commitment to infusing joy and interaction into the world of nature and music.
