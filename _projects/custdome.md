### **Ränna Hälli** 
Our project aimed to address the challenges of maintaining greenhouse conditions sustainably and efficiently. 
Vision Dome tasked us with developing a passive, environmentally friendly system for their GreenDome model. 
After extensive user research, we identified the need for an automated watering system and a rainwater collection solution. 
Our solution, Ränna Hälli, combines these functionalities. The system uses ceramics for osmotic pressure-driven irrigation, eliminating the need for external energy, 
and gutters that collect rainwater for storage. User testing confirmed its effectiveness, leading to a more sustainable and user-friendly greenhouse ecosystem.
