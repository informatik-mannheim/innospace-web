### **connected** 

In direct relation to the company’s line of business, Valtech Mobility posed a challenge to us through HAMK and Inno Space Design Factories, where we were tasked with the responsibility of determining, “How might we provide a Multi-Touchpoint solution for car drivers (company or private cars) that supports “Seamless Fueling “/touchless payment experience at the gas station?
At the beginning of the project, we had identified that even though we are dealing with the refueling process we cannot affect the physical act of it, what we could affect is the payment process. What we discovered next is that the bigger pains are laying right there. With our solution, we have eliminated the biggest ones –walking to the shop to pay for gas and keeping mileage numbers in mind. We have created a touchless payment experience at the gas station and reduced the amount of stress and frustration associated with the process.
