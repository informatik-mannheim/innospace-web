### **Ben the Bin** 

Team Micro Change tackeld the challenge "How can we use smart objects to help people understand and act accordingly regarding climate change?"

After various iterations the team came up with Ben the Bin.
Ben the smart garbage can is best suited for paper and packaging waste. In the base of the smart trash garbage can are load cells, as we determine the production of waste by weight. Statistics and achievements are shown to users on a display. Achievements are intended to motivate users to be more conscious and better at dealing with their waste.
