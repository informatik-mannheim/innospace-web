### **Smellivision** 

Company SNIFFDRONE in collaboration with ATTRACT challenged our team Scent-Sationals to
create an application for the ongoing project SNIFFIRDRONE. The final product revolves around
the application of cutting-edge technology aiming to create an innovative product capable of
identifying airborne viruses. Providing healthcare professionals with an invaluable resource to
effectively combat the transmission of infectious diseases. The primary challenge is the difficulty
hospitals encounter in identifying COVID-19, especially in high-risk areas. Transmission is reduced
and aids hospitals in maintaining a safe environment. Equipping with proper tools, we empower to
proactively safeguard themselves and others. This device holds the promise of saving lives,
preventing outbreaks, and relieving the burden on healthcare systems.
