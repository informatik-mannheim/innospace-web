### **Team Kolo** 

Our current predominantly linear economy is leading to global warming, supply shortages and pollution. 
A circular economy could help combat these problems by keeping resources in circulation longer. 
This avoids greenhouse gas emissions, gives resources enough time to renew themselves and creates less waste.
The Green Industry Cluster of the City of Mannheim contributes to making Mannheim a leading region for green technologies. 
This also includes supporting companies in working together on a circular economy. 
They challenged us to create an online marketplace for resource trading that facilitates the exchange of secondary raw materials for companies.
Our solution "Kolo" combines a trading platform with a knowledge platform where companies can find offers and suggestions for sustainable alternative materials. 
"Kolo" integrates content from other websites and platforms, making the search for secondary raw materials particularly convenient for companies. 
This means that everything needed to participate in the circular economy by trading materials and sharing scientific knowledge can be found in one place.
Kolo makes it easy for everyone to take the next step towards a more sustainable future.
