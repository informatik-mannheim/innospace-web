### **Access Mannheim** 

In a world where we are increasingly dependent on digital alternatives for collaboration and communication, especially at the time of COVID19, video meetings and group chats have become more and more embedded in our daily lives. However, this drastic shift in many forms of digital communication poses a great challenge for the group of people with disabilities. The city of Mannheim challenged the team to investigate “How might we reach and empower people with different types of disabilities to participate using digital formats?”.

The solution ENABL. aims to simplify the process of contacting and booking a sign language interpreter as while seemingly simple, this process proved to be a very prominent challenge for deaf people. While ENABL. only focuses on the first step of a deaf person's journey towards active participation in public life, it shortens the time and limits the frustration of estabslishing first contact with sign language interpreters, especially in urgent situations. 

In their own words, the students "hope to get closer to a complete barrier-free digital experience and to make the digital life of many disabled people easier."
