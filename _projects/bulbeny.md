### **Bul Beny** 

You enter a university, a hospital or a large building complex and quickly lose track of where you are. Google Maps may take you to the front door, but once inside you're on your own. Finding rooms in complex structures can be a real challenge.

Bul Beni is an innovative, community-based platform that makes orientation easy. It allows users to create and share routes to specific rooms. These routes consist of photos and clear text descriptions that explain the route step by step, creating a growing database of precise directions. Bul Beni is the perfect companion for anyone who needs to find their way around universities, hospitals or office complexes. This platform combines technological simplicity with the power of an active community.
Never get lost again - thanks to Bul Beni! Celebrate this innovative solution with us.
