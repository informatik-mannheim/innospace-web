### **DAMU** 

is a medical technology kit that enhances possibilities during teleconsultation with a focus on human touch. DAMU, creates nearby medical practices and appointments within a day.
Onsite medical staff provides information, help and in-person medical follow-ups. In
combination with that we have developed three tools that enable doctors to perform
remote auscultation while meeting patients online.
The four tools developed by us include: Innovative Stethoscope, Pulse Tablet, Dermatologic Camera and Help Button.
