### **Bloom Buddy** 

Many people love to beautify their homes with plants, but there is often no time for proper care in stressful everyday life or during longer absences. Dried-out plants or overburdened friends who have to step in are a well-known problem.

Bloom Buddy is a smart flower pot that automatically waters plants as soon as they need it thanks to an integrated moisture sensor. A large water reservoir keeps plants alive for several weeks, ideal for travelling or a busy schedule. Moisture levels can be checked and notifications received via an app with a smart home connection. The Bloom Buddy is not only functional, but also stylish and the perfect solution for anyone who wants to enrich their home with green life without having to worry about maintenance.

More time, more comfort, more greenery. Join us in celebrating the fusion of technology and nature care.
