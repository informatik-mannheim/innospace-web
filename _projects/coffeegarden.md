### **Coffee Garden** 

Jumping into the coffee universe without much expectations, the team was challenged to explore the question “How might we develop an automated control system for coffee roasting?".

The project was sponsored by Coffee Consulate in Mannheim, an independent training
and research center that works based on scientific knowledge and research in the coffee
industry. By automizing the roasting process and creating an online platform to provide 
knowledge about coffee roasting, the team believes to have found the best solution on the
market yet to answer the question.

Coffee Garden is the name of the online platform where roasters from all around the world
can join a roasters' community. There the members can have discussions, share knowledge,
network and learn more about coffee roasting. AUROMA is the name of the hardware aspect of
the solution. It works as an interface between the open source software Artisan,  very widely used in the coffee industry, and small gas-powered commercial roasting machines. Roasters can successfully automate the roasting process by implementing AUROMA to their current roasting machines.
