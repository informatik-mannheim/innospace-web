### **Kaleidoscope**

The company Strategy Compass posted the challenge "How might we leverage social interaction to facilitate digital soft skill development in organization?".

After many iterations, the team generated the solution Kaleidoscope and used their prototype to show how to become a social butterfly.
Kaleidoscope is a platform that uses various commonly used platforms to connect employees. By introducing social soft skill activities to the companies ecosystem, employees should become better team players.
The target user doesn't have to spend extra time learning soft skills, because the user improves his soft skills while using our tool. The tool is a productivity tool, so itâ€™s used everyday and the working processes become even more structured. In addition our platform offers lectures about diverse topics. This also includes more information related to the activities.
