### **Cell Care** 

ICell Care is an automated, low-cost system designed to change the media in cell culture flasks, commonly used by biologists in research and academic labs to cultivate prokaryotic cells. These cells require regular media changes for nutrients, which are traditionally done manually, often requiring lab visits during inconvenient times.

Cell Care eliminates the need for manual media changes, allowing users to monitor their cells remotely via microscopic images. The system is compatible with 90% of incubators and consists of two main parts:

Removable Trays: These hold the cell culture flasks and the media warming system.
Permanent Components: These are installed in the incubator and house the electronics, pumps, and media cooling system.

To use Cell Care, users set up the cell culture flasks as usual, fill the new media tank, and attach a special flask cap with tubing. The trays are then placed in the incubator, and the tubing is connected to the pump. The media exchange process is managed via a web app, ensuring sterility as all media-contacting parts are sterile consumables.

The system warms the media, pumps out the old media, and pumps in the new media at user-set intervals. Users can monitor and control the process remotely or via an integrated screen and buttons on the device. After the set number of exchanges, the tray can be detached and returned to the bio safety cabinet for further processing.
