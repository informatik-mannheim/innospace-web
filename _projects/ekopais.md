### **WOBOT** 

The WOBOT is a single soil robot, with proportions like the European earthworm. As a team, multiple worms support the agricultural industry, by reducing the excess nitrogen in the soil. Together, with the autonomous field robot called WOBOT Kindergarten using CERN Technology CERNbot, the WOBOTs collect fertilizer before it reaches our groundwater. Once it is collected, it can be processed into new fertilizer for need-based application. This shall help against the consequences of pollution in the environment like eutrophication and reduce the lack of fertilizer.
